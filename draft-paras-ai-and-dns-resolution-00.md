.\# Abstract  
The RFC proposes a mechanism to generate DNS responses in a human-readable format using Large Language Models (LLM).

{mainmatter}

\# Introduction   
The DNS query responses are largely meant for machines to interpret and deep protocol knowledge is required for humans to understand the responses. Currently, DNS is used for various use cases such as domain ownership proof by adding TXT/CNAME records to zones or adding email security related DKIM, DMARC records. Due to these and many such use cases, non-DNS SME are required to understand and interpret DNS queries. 

This RFC proposes techniques for resolvers to interface with Large Language Models (LLM) to generate human-readable responses, to DNS queries when certain llm-specific parameters are sent in query headers. The LLMs use Generative Artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret Authoritative server generated responses and convert them into human-readable responses.

\# Terminology

\# Implementation Considerations

\#\# Resolver changes

The DNS transportation specific llm-specific parameters required to be sent to the resolver by the DNS clients is specified in the Transportation protocols section. 

This section specifies how resolvers should behave after receiving llm-specific parameters. The resolver will continue to recursively query the authoritative servers for a response in the standard RFC 1035 defined manner. In case, an llm-specific parameter is received by the resolver from the DNS client, the resolver MUST send the final query response to an LLM. The resolver will receive an LLM-generated response and send it to the client using the transportation specific protocol.

The RFC does not mandate any particular LLM choice but RECOMMENDS using the latest version of an LLM.

\#\# DNS Client changes

The DNS clients MUST be able to include llm-specific parameters in DNS queries sent to the resolver and MUST be able to display the llm-generated responses to the clients.

\#\# Transportation protocols

DOH  
The RFC proposes a new media type "application/dns-message-llm"  that will be sent to DOH resolvers by DNS clients that want llm-generated DNS responses. The query format specified in RFC8484 stays the same. The human-readable response will be sent to the DNS client application. 

UDP  
The llm-generated response would be in free-format text and would not fit into UDP packet size. Hence UDP MUST not be used for transportation

TCP  
The llm-generated response would be in free-format text and TCP is RECOMMENDED transportation for DNS queries.

\#\# DNSSEC and LLM-generated responses  
The LLM generated responses cannot be DNSSEC signed since those are generated by resolvers and not authoritative servers. 

\# IANA Considerations

TBD

\# Security Considerations

\# Privacy Considerations
